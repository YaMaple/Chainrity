      title: 'How to think about the unstoppable rise of index funds',
      content:
          '''The history of modern finance is littered with ideas that worked well enough at small scale—railway bonds, Japanese skyscrapers, sliced-and-diced mortgage securities—but morphed into monstrosities once too many punters piled in. When it comes to sheer size, no mania can compare with that for passive investing. Funds that track the entire market by buying shares in every company in America’s s&p 500, say, rather than guessing which will perform better than average, have attained giant scale. Fully 40% of the total net assets managed by funds in America are in passive vehicles, reckons the Investment Company Institute, an industry group. The phenomenon warrants scrutiny.
Index funds have grown because of the validity of the core insight underpinning them: conventional investment funds are, by and large, a terrible proposition. The vast majority fail to beat the market over the years. Hefty management fees paid by investors in such ventures, often around 1-2% a year (and more for snazzy hedge funds), add up to giant bonuses for stockpickers. Index funds, by contrast, charge nearly nothing (0.04% for a large equity fund) and do a good job of hugging their chosen benchmark. Given time, they almost inevitably leave active managers in the dust.''',

    title: 'How environmental damage can lead to new diseases',
    content:
        '''THE WORLD’S monitored populations of wild animals have decreased by an average of 68% in the past 50 years, according to the Worldwide Fund for Nature. Deforestation, intensive farming and the changing use of land are largely to blame. But nature can recover, provided it is given a chance. COP15, a UN biodiversity summit that took place last week, sought to do just that. More than 100 countries recognised the need to reverse species decline by 2030 and acknowledged the consequences of harmful environmental practices and climate change for biodiversity. These efforts are long overdue—and not just for the sake of wildlife. The same actions that threaten ecosystems endanger human health too.
Growing evidence points to a connection between destructive environmental practices and emerging diseases. Exactly how one leads to the other is not yet fully understood, as the struggle to establish the origin of covid-19 shows (the virus may have leaked from a lab, or “spilled over” from bats into humans, via an intermediary species). Why are changes in ecosystems linked to the spread of disease, and what increases the risk of outbreaks?''',

    title: 'The meaning of South Africa’s most popular magazine',
    imageUrl: 'assets/images/south.jpg',
    content:
        '''Aglance at its website belies the historical significance of Huisgenoot, the magazine with the highest circulation in South Africa. Among the most-read stories in early October were “Skokoomblik toe bruidegom se rug tydens onthaal breek” and “Vrou se oog per ongeluk met supergom toegeplak”. For those unfamiliar with Afrikaans, the language spoken at home by 12% of South Africans, these tales concern the “Shocking moment when groom’s back breaks during wedding reception” and the sticky situation in which a “Woman’s eye is accidentally glued shut with super glue”.
It is a far cry from the early days of the magazine. After the Anglo-Boer war (1899-1902) there was what Herman Giliomee, a historian, calls “the building of an Afrikaner ethnic consciousness” among the disparate group of South Africans of mostly Dutch descent. Important to that effort was Huisgenoot (Home companion), launched in 1916. It presented Afrikaner history as a heroic epic, extolled Afrikaner literature and helped standardise Afrikaans as its articles were used in school comprehension tests.''',

    title: 'Samsung Electronics wants to dominate cutting-edge chipmaking',

    content:
        '''Samsung electronics (se) is a behemoth. The South Korean tech company is the crown jewel of the mighty Samsung chaebol, as the country’s conglomerates are known. It makes more smartphones than any other company in the world, as well as home-entertainment systems and appliances. It dominates the manufacturing of memory chips, which are used to store data on electronic devices and whose price has been pushed up by the global semiconductor shortage. se’s annual revenues of 200bn are not much lower than those of Apple, the most valuable firm in history, and it is sitting on a cash pile of 100bn.
Now both se and its parent group, whose name means “three stars”, are entering a critical new chapter. In August Lee Jae-yong, the scion of the family which founded Samsung in 1938, was released from prison, where he spent two stints after a conviction for his involvement in a bribery scandal. He is finally taking full control of the empire from his late father, Lee Kun-hee, who died last year. Succession was complicated first by the elder Lee’s six-year coma, then by his son’s bribery conviction, linked to se’s efforts to win the government’s backing for a merger of two Samsung subsidiaries that would cement his control.''',

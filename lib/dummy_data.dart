    title: 'Swiss aviation industry launches layoff plan',
    content:
        '''On the 29th local time, Swissair’s chairman of the board of directors Reto Francini said that it is hoped that the aviation business volume in the summer of 2021 will reach 50% of the pre-epidemic volume. Whether intercontinental routes can be restored is critical to achieving this goal. If contrary to expectations, there is still no significant improvement next summer, layoffs will be unavoidable. Previously, Swissair had announced that it would lay off 1,000 employees within two years by freezing recruitment, adopting part-time work plans and early retirement of employees. Reto Francini also pointed out that there is little hope for the aviation industry to recover quickly, and it is expected that it will not be able to operate normally until 2024.''',

        '''Samsung electronics (se) is a behemoth. The South Korean tech company is the crown jewel of the mighty Samsung chaebol, as the country’s conglomerates are known. It makes more smartphones than any other company in the world, as well as home-entertainment systems and appliances. It dominates the manufacturing of memory chips, which are used to store data on electronic devices and whose price has been pushed up by the global semiconductor shortage. se’s annual revenues of 200bn are not much lower than those of Apple, the most valuable firm in history, and it is sitting on a cash pile of 100bn.
Now both se and its parent group, whose name means “three stars”, are entering a critical new chapter. In August Lee Jae-yong, the scion of the family which founded Samsung in 1938, was released from prison, where he spent two stints after a conviction for his involvement in a bribery scandal. He is finally taking full control of the empire from his late father, Lee Kun-hee, who died last year. Succession was complicated first by the elder Lee’s six-year coma, then by his son’s bribery conviction, linked to se’s efforts to win the government’s backing for a merger of two Samsung subsidiaries that would cement his control.''',

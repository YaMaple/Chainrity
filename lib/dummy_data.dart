      title: 'China Big Tech\'s Charitable Donations Are Hurting Their Stocks',
      content:
          '''Chinese tech giants\' increasing charitable pledges may be contributing toward Xi Jinping\'s “common prosperity” vision, but they have also been costing investors.

Stocks of all seven listed companies giving details of donations and pledges for various causes this year were sold off in the trading session following those moves, according to Bloomberg compiled data, which don\'t include pledging announcements that were clubbed with earnings releases.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. was the latest Chinese tech company to pledge \$15.5 billion over five years on 10 initiatives encompassing technology investment and support for small companies, local media reported Thursday. Tencent Holdings Ltd. said last month it will double the money it\'s allocating for social responsibility programs to about \$15 billion.

Chinese corporations and billionaires have pledged and directed more than \$37 billion to charity so far this year through corporate interests, foundations or personal wealth, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

    title: 'Billionaire Donations Soar in China Push for \'Common Prosperity\'',
    content:
        '''Seven Chinese billionaires have directed a record \$5 billion to charity so far this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News, a sum that exceeds by 20% total national giving in 2020. Their pledges, whether through corporate interests, foundations or personal wealth, arrive as President Xi Jinping pushes for \"common prosperity,\" a sprawling campaign to close the country\'s wealth gap.
        
Xi has emphasized wealth redistribution within China, referring to \"common prosperity\" goals at least 65 times in speeches and meetings this year, more than double the 30 mentions in all of last year.
        
It\'s not clear what all the policy implications of the campaign will include, but China has identified a \"third distribution of wealth\" -- individual giving and corporate philanthropy -- alongside government and market interventions.
        
In a high-level meeting chaired by Xi on Aug. 17, the government said it \"should reasonably adjust excessive incomes and encourage high-income people and companies to give back more to society.\" This idea of a \"social hand,\" according to state media, will rely on moral obligation and social expectation to inspire the country\'s richest to divest some of their personal wealth.

        'China\'s JD.com CEO joins billionaire charity rush with \$2.3 bln share pledge',

    content:
        '''JD.com founder and CEO Richard Liu will donate company shares worth about \$2.34 billion to charity, the Chinese e-commerce giant said on Wednesday, adding to a list of similar philanthropic pledges from the country's top tech billionaires.

The move comes as China tightens scrutiny on its tech sector, including JD.com and rival Alibaba Group Holding , as part of President Xi Jinping's "common prosperity" drive to ease inequality in the world's second-largest economy.

Liu will give away about 62.4 million Class B ordinary JD shares, the company disclosed in a filing, without specifying the third-party foundation receiving the donation.

American depository shares in JD, each representing two ordinary shares of the company, closed at \$75.08 on Tuesday and were last trading down nearly 1.9% on Wednesday.''',

        '''Dumfries-based charity Massive Outpouring Of Love – D&G Refugee Action is sending a convoy of vehicles loaded with donated items for Ukraine on Tuesday. After a major appeal for gifted items the volunteers called a halt this week to goods donations while they worked to pack all the items they expect to send on the convoy. They have been given use of a depot at Marchmount Drive, by Dumfries and Galloway Council, for a month to sort and pack aid for the Ukrainian refugees in Europe. A spokesperson for the charity said that after attending a meeting of the UK refugee charities it was confirmed that “there is very little demand for clothing at present and there isn’t expected to be much for the foreseeable future”.''',

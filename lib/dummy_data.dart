        '''Dumfries-based charity Massive Outpouring Of Love – D&G Refugee Action is sending a convoy of vehicles loaded with donated items for Ukraine on Tuesday. After a major appeal for gifted items the volunteers called a halt this week to goods donations while they worked to pack all the items they expect to send on the convoy. They have been given use of a depot at Marchmount Drive, by Dumfries and Galloway Council, for a month to sort and pack aid for the Ukrainian refugees in Europe. A spokesperson for the charity said that after attending a meeting of the UK refugee charities it was confirmed that “there is very little demand for clothing at present and there isn’t expected to be much for the foreseeable future”.''',
